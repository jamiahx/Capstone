CURRENT OUTLINE {
What can individuals do to  start or join a free (as in freedom)/open mesh network and why would they? (make sure to explain free (as in freedom))
Open Mesh Networks can potentially give an individual the freedom to be connected wherever and whenever, and freedom from economic and social injustice.

The current Internet is a mesh network, but ${#!WIRED_CONS}
That’s where Mesh Networking comes in...
What is a Wireless Mesh Network? Iridium Network
Why use one?
Why isn’t it used right now? It is, you just don’t know about it.
Wouldn’t ${PROBLEMS} make it difficult to use?
Aren’t Open Networks illegal?
What are the factions within the Wireless Mesh Community?
How can I join?

Not Technical Paper
Hugely lopsided
Transcribe the Outline
Denote where I need research
Thesis needs to have free and open
